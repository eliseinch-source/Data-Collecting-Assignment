My plan for this assignment is to create a symetric 9 cell 2d square grid. The rules include: Each cell has multiple states, not just death. This means that my cells will keep regenerating based on their "energy" level. 0 is death, and 1-3 is increasingor decreasing energy but alive. Each of the cells has eight neighbors in a 3X3 setup that is symmetrical. If cell has no energy it turns red and can disapear, while the alive cells are green. The darker the green color, the more energy the cell has. If the cell is red, they are at 0, and if they are any shade of green, they are 1-3. I also might do s and e which could be the cell's current energy (e) and (s) the overall energy of all cells. If the overall energy is 4, and the cell's energy is 0 the cell will gain energy of 1 and become a shade of light green. If the overall is less than 3 and the cell's energy is larger than 3, the cell loses energy of 1.
